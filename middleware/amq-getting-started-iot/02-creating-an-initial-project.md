For this scenario, let's create a project called ``example`` by running the command:

``oc new-project example``{{execute HOST1}}

You should see output similar to:

```
Now using project "example" on server "https://172.17.0.41:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
```

In the next step, you will create a new IoT project instance.
